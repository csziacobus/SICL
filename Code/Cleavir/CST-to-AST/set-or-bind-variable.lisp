;;; ENV is an environment that is known to contain information about
;;; the variable VARIABLE, but we don't know whether it is special or
;;; lexical.  VALUE-AST is an AST that computes the value to be given
;;; to VARIABLE.  NEXT-AST is an AST that represents the computation
;;; to take place after the variable has been given its value.  If the
;;; variable is special, this function creates a BIND-AST with
;;; NEXT-AST as its body.  If the variable is lexical, this function
;;; creates a PROGN-AST with two ASTs in it.  The first one is a
;;; LEXICAL-BINDING-AST that assigns the value to the variable, and
;;; the second one is the NEXT-AST.
